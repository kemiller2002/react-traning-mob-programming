          >This is a good intro to react. It talks about the basic parts of the
          application along with a quick overview of webpack etc. The first 3
          videos are the most important as we aren't using redux which is video
          4 on. You might want to check it out anyway since it is a nice
          introduction to it and you can at least understand what it is.
